how did i do it: oneeeeee line at a time! again! i worry that i'll have a hard time doing this on the spot, to be honest... it's daunting! i want time to listen to every little thing i'm doing, but i'm trying to embrace the *lack* of that and more just accept what i've splattered onto the page. so this was really just, lots of splattering.
i have to say i was surprised by the lack of... properly melodic samples? i feel like i'm going to need to add my own. i felt like early on i had the patch at a point here i wanted to add a "driving" melody, but could never find a sound that actually made that possible for me. maybe i just need to do some more digging. in the end i just decided this was going to be more of a soundscape lol.
