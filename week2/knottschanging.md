## two __new__ things
- Wow, I had never given a lot of thought to the idea that you could draw so much comparison between political groups/ideologies and music groups!  I never expected to see "authoritarian states" and "pop music band" on the same graph, but there it was.

- I didn't know that network orchestras had so many roots in political movement. I had never heard of #Occupy and Crisis R Us but now I see how that ideology is truly engrained in the idea of a network orchestra, a place where data flows freely and equally between members. The concept is really cool. It sort of makes me wonder what the direction of this idea could have gone if it wasn't operating under the branch of an "orchestra." This could have been an underground hacker ring if it wanted to, I think.

## two __knew__ things
- As someone with a classical, orchestral background, I found this article extremely interesting as it detailed the differences in musician input in a traditional ensemble setting vs a network orchestra setting.

- I guess this isn't a thing I knew, but more like a thought that came up. So, as stated, I've got a classical background. A lot of this is boggling my mind. The direct opposition to traditional orchestral structures (and traditional structures in general) is interesting, and definitely the way we're going for the future, but I don't always find it to be the most satisfying or serving of an idea. I think there is a lot of value to still having a traditional structure, so I didn't always love that the article seemed to rank the network orchestra highest above other forms of music making (i.e string quartet) and I don't think it's totally true that "performer innovation is not desirable" in those situations. But a lot of times, yeah, it is. It's tough. I think as we evolve as a society we are trying more and more to dismantle existing hierarchies where we used to try to build and serve old ones. It's different.

But that's a topic I wrestle with a lot personally, coming from the classical background and now trying to find my way in this new world, part of that new world being the network orchestra. I'm very intrigued by reading these articles and challenging my previous opinions and looking at my previous attachments.

```stack [ s "bd sd bd bd", s "{~ ~ ~ hc/4}", s "[[cp mt lt mt] ht ht]", s "{hh hh hh hh}*3", s "{ho ~ bd hh ht ~}*2"]```

how you did it: one stack at a time! started simple with a four on the floor and then just embellished layer by layer

the problems you faced & how i overcame them: once i got to the version with 4 stacks of sounds, i had trouble adding more without totally burying the groove that i already had. so i just put it off to the side and started testing out individual stacks again to try and layer them all up in the end. i only ended up adding one more stack once i was happy, because i didn't want it to be insane, but it took me a while to get something i was pleased with. also, lotsa syntax errors/learning about that. feels very similar to any kind of coding though, so it's not unfamiliar. i was also just dying to add a melody but didn't want to do the thing that would break the system lol
