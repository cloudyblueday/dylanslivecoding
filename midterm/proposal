helloo. i apologize for my day-before e-mail, but i will just stick to my original proposition there and detail it:

if allowed, i'd like to talk about [Illest Preacha](https://portfolio.illestpreacha.com/work) and his work that combines live coding + poetry. i think he has a really interesting mindset that "code - poetry" and i think that diving into a live coder who's been doing it for ten years would give me lots to talk about!

if that's not cool, i think i'd talk about Slub, one of (if not The) first live coding duos out there. they perhaps invented the term algorave? it'd be like a "Slub: Early 2000s origins of live generative coding!" presentation.

accepting thoughts & criticism thank youuu this is a new subject for me i am DAUNTED
