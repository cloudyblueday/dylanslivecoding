hi rachel!! happy spring break. hope it is as restful for you as i need it to be for me :,)

as my years as a musician have gone on, i've become less and less of a live performer, starting and then dwindling out of classical piano. once i got to berklee, i almost stopped performing entirely, save for a few performances with my new singer-songwriter thing on guitar. then....... i don't know what possessed me but i said LIVE CODING. then here we are with my first ever live electronic performance, and man was it a doozy.

i really love the idea of it! but it is quite hard to pull off in the moment! Ben told me our performance lasted maybe twelve minutes and i was shocked. it felt like MAYBE three. and it was very agonizing.

at the start, we had a really great synergy and were inspired by the "fates" performance video that you showed us, and were planning to do a sort of "battle" or "switchoff" type performance. on the first week (of planning), we left confident with the idea that there would be four boxes, one for each category: noise, melody, drums and hydra, and that we would Physically switch between computers every two-ish minutes. i was really interested by this idea as like a live performance aspect, to sort of stop and start and dig into someone else's work by leaving your own behind, but when we came back on the second week of planning ... no one wanted to do that anymore, and we couldn't agree on what else to do... so we just improvised.

it was ... ok... ... oof. i wish we had planned more. the motivation was just gone. we jammed all of the second week's class and discussed, and i thought i could pull something better off real-time as we had when there were no stakes! but it was so different when it was the "real" performance. this is the first semester i've ever had to live perform with technology and i Really don't have the vocabulary yet. it's so new to me! and i'm a junior in epd. X_X i'm really trying to digest as much as i can! its a lot.

anyway. it was a learning experience for me. never shall i perform anything again without a major plan, or at least a proper guideline. i'm looking forward to taking this experience and making use of it in the live performance, which i really want to nail!!

happy spring breaaaaak
