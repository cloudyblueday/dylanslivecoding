## two __new__ things
- The **BoSSA**! I had never seen it before and wow it looks funky. Like a magic music rubiks cube. I love seeing new takes on older parts, like using a bow for a multidirectional speaker?? Crazy!
- I had also never heard of PLOrk. (Honestly, I... have never really listened to a network orchestra.) This whole concept is pretty new to me and especially interesting. Each day I learn more about stuff I never thought I would (like, taking the Max class is so crazy for me now, an ex-classical musician) so I'm just pretty hyped to be on the 21st century train with this stuff


## two __knew__ things
- I am pretty familiar with the makeup of a traditional orchestra and was really interested in how this article was still very aware of the what the typical orchestral "expectations" are and how a laptop orchestra both plays within those expectations and creates new ideas outside of them. Like retaining the idea of a conductor, because they're super important!
- 'As far as I could tell, they were all checking their e-mail.' I feel like this is the most that *I* know about a laptop orchestra and definitely my initial perception of it too, haha, but I was glad to hear him discuss this topic and what are the differences + solutions.
